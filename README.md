# NodeJS weather app
[Deutsch](./README_DE.md)

This is my first ExpressJS application to learn the basics of setting up a NodeJS server with the framework ExpressJS.
This simple app uses external weather API to retrieve weather at the searched location.

Process
1. User enters a place
2. Look up the coordinates of the place with Mapbox
3. Retrieve and show weather information from Weatherstack by coordinates
